### Project: HireLah

HireLah is a CLI-based app that offers help for recruiters who need to managed hundreds of applicants per day.
By having short and simple syntax, HireLah helps to accelerate the normal scheduling and filtering process.
The app is most suitable for CLI-preferred users, but GUI is also provided to choose.  It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Sort feature in `list` command
  * Added new optional parameters to the list command to allow sorting of different data types.
  * This allows user to easily view the data with respect of the first and last occurrence.

* **New Feature**: Export CSV command
