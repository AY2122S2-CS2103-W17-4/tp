### Project: HireLah

HireLah is a CLI-based app that offers help for recruiters who need to managed hundreds of applicants per day.
By having short and simple syntax, HireLah helps to accelerate the normal scheduling and filtering process.
The app is most suitable for CLI-preferred users, but GUI is also provided to choose.  It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
