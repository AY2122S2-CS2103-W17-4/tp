### Project: HireLah

HireLah is a desktop app that helps recruiters to manage talent and job candidates by tracking every step of the hiring process, from offering positions to scheduling interviews with candidates. It is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) users while still offering a GUI, so that power users can accomplish tasks much quicker by using commands . It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
